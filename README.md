# Coding-Challenge-4
# Electric Car Class Implementation Challenge

## Overview
This project is designed to enhance your understanding of inheritance in object-oriented programming by extending a `Car` class to create an `Electric Vehicle (EV)` class. The EV class will include additional properties and methods specific to electric vehicles.

## Objectives
- Implement the EV class by extending the Car class.
- Add additional properties and methods to the EV class.
- Override methods from the Car class in the EV class.
- Test the EV class to ensure it behaves as expected.
